# Python_fromScratc, my Learning Journey üêç

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey into Python, approached from the perspective of a computer scientist looking to **adapt to Python‚Äôs ecosystem** for real-world applications.

While many of the concepts covered here are foundational, the motivation behind this project goes well beyond the basics. My main goals include:

- Learning Python as a springboard to **CUDA parallel programming**
- Gaining fluency for **LLM, ML/AI development**
- Using **network simulation** to deepen my understanding of protocol design (e.g., TCP/IP)

This repo is structured progressively ‚Äî from language fundamentals to more practical coding exercises ‚Äî and is continuously evolving as I move toward more advanced topics.

## üìÇ Project Folders

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `1_essentials/`   | Input/output, variable assignment, and type casting basics. |
| `2_math/`         | Arithmetic operations, math functions like `pow` and `round`, and intro to the `math` module. |
| `3_conditions/`   | Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), logical operators, and ternary-style expressions. |
| `4_strings/`      | String manipulation, indexing, slicing, and formatting (incl. f-strings and format specifiers). |
| `5_loops/`        | `for` and `while` loops, nested loops, and basic timing with the `time` library. |
| `6_Collections/`  | Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, 2D collections, and their use cases. |
| `7_random_lib/`   | Using Python's `random` module to generate random values for simulations and examples. |
| `practice/`       | Mini-projects and exercises applying concepts from the essentials (e.g. shopping cart, quiz games). |

## üî≠ What's Next?

This repo is a foundation for diving deeper into:

- **Parallel computing** with Python (via CUDA and Numba)
- **Machine learning and AI** (leveraging libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Network simulations** to model and analyze communication protocols

As this journey continues, expect more folders and more focused projects to appear ‚Äî including `llm_experiments/`, `cuda_python/`, and `network_simulations/`.
